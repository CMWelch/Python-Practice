# Python_Projects
Various exercises for Python
I have recently learned Python and have become interested in it's capablilities. Machine Learning has always seemed interesting to me so I have begun learning that as well as a some different Data Science technologies. I have recently just learned MatPlot Lib and Pandas.

Future Goals
1. Create a video/audio playback application using Python and Kivy as the GUI Framework
2. Continue study of Machine Learning with Linear Regression
3. Continue study of Data Science with Seaborn, Plotly, and Cufflinks
